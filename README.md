# discord-spammer

Run ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` then open discord and select a DM, or server channel you want to spam then run ``` python main.py ```.
To stop just close the app the python script is running in :)

I made this to mess around with my friends, thankfully they didn't get mad at me.
